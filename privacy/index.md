# Privacy Policy

[_Uralys_](http://uralys.com) games are operated and maintained by [@chrisdugne](https://twitter.com/chrisdugne).

This document outlines the data handling practices for all _Uralys_ mobile games.

My games:

- Do not collect any personal information
- Do not collect location data
- Do not have third party advertisements

The term “personal information” refers to personally identifiable information through which a user can be identified as an individual.

The term “Non-personal information” refers to information that does not directly identify a user.

## Collection and Use of Personal Information via my apps:

I do not collect any personal information through my apps. Simple as that.

## Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information via our apps:

For analytics purposes, anonymous and aggregated data may be collected, using Google Analytics.

- Navigational information: What screen you access on the game, how long you spend on each page;
- Usage information: Analytics tied to your use of the game features, such as when you start, win or lose a game, get gems etc...

For more information on how Google Analytics use this data see: https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245
